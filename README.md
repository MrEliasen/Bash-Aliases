# Bash Aliases

#### Install

Please use these at your own risk. Never blindly trust and install any of the aliases, and please look through them all and make sure you are happy with them.   
Alternatively, just copy across the ones you want and leave out the rest (Recommended!).

 * Clone locally
 * ``` $ bash setup.sh```
 * Profit!

#### Contribute

If you want to add any of your own alases, please do NOT add them to the main ```bash_aliases``` file. Instead, append them to the ```bash_aliases_extras``` file, using the following format:

```
# Your Git Username
alias do="some stuff"
```

###### Example

```
# MrEliasen
alias back="cd .."
```
